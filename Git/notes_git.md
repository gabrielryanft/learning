# Git notes - Notes i make while i learn git ( FreeCodeCamp video with @HiteshCodeLab )

## repo (short for repository)

a directory

## git status

show if the current repository is a git repository.

## git init

make the current dir a git repo

## Commit (checkpoint)

### git add

adds the file(s)/dir(s) to a "commit bag" (this is not commited yet)

If you have two files, x and y, and you want to track only x, do:

`$ git add x ( not the whole dir with . (dot) )`

### git commit

commit what you've put inside the "commit bag"

always with the -m flag, to commit with a message:

`$ git commit -m "add file x"`

### git push

send to cloud, github, gitlab *et citera*

## git log

log the details about commits

## .gitignore

a file that tells git what not to include in the repo.

## creating branch (ramification)

`$ git branch name_of_branch`

### swich branches

`$ git checkout name_of_branch`

goes to branch name_of_branch

running `git branch`, the pointer will point to name_of_branc, not to master.

What you commit im a branch will stay in that branch (if you dont merge with other branch)

If the branch does not exist, use `git checkout -b name_of_new_branch` or `git switch -c name_of_new_branch` and it will create a branch and move you there.

### merging branches

merge current branch with other:
`$ git merge other_branch` 

#### merge conflicts

if the same file is diferent in the merged branches(conflicts can occur in and out of the master branch.), it gives a "error":
HEAD = current branch (can be seen in .git/HEAD, i.e. show the name of current branch.)

```
<<<<<<< HEAD 
<tbody>			\
	<tr>1</tr>   |      
	<tr>2</tr>    \  file in the 
	<tr>3</tr>    /   current branch   
	<tr>4</tr>   |      
</tbody>		/ 
=======         
<ul>				\
	<li>this</li>    |
	<li>p</li>        > file in the
	<li>p</li>       |   other branch
	<li>p</li>      /   
</ul>         
>>>>>>> other_branch
```

### delete branch 

`git branch -d branch_name` (-d stands for delete.)

## git diff

### diffing branches: 

to see the diference between branches, do `git diff branchname` it comparess the currrent branch with the other one.


or `git diff branc1 branch2` to compare 2 branches (not necessarily the one you are in and an other one)

\* if you are in an old version of git use:

`git diff branc1..branch2`

Ex. output: ( inside parentheses are my observations )
```
diff --git a/index.html b/index.html

`git diff commit_id1 commit_id2`

Ex.:
Â´$ git log --oneline`
output:

## git stash

### archiving changes

"archive" the uncommited changes so you can do something. (without losing your changes.)

when you stash your changes, they are taken out from the files.

`git stash`

\* this command stashes the changes in the current branch.

### list stashes

before stashing anything, run `git stash list`, to see if some thing is already stashed in the current branch

### unstashing / popping

stashed changes can be pop(d? i don't know how to write), unstashed, with:

`git stash pop`

\* stashes change branch with you, so, pay atention with what you are pop(ing?). unstashing in the wrong place can cause the same "problem" as a merge conflict.

### apply specific stash

`git stash apply stash@{n}`

## make experiments on past commits without affecting the current state of branch

`git checkout commit_id`

this creates a new banch separated from the parent branch.

to keep something you do in the "test branch" make a branch from inside the copy one.

or use head and the number of commits you want to go back.

`git checkout HEAD~2`

Ex.:
`git log --oneline`

output: 

```
2c77f9b (HEAD -> change) change index
5e557f1 Merge branch 'master' into change
cf46bbb change index
1be733a change index
2e57c4a Merge branch 'change'
01575e4 updated index
652a907 change index.html
9b7ef17 fackd ap index
```

with the command `git checkout HEAD~1` you get:

2c77f9b (HEAD -> change) change index		from here,
5e557f1 Merge branch 'master' into change	to here

but with the command `git checkout HEAD~2` you get:

2c77f9b (HEAD -> change) change index		from here, 
5e557f1 Merge branch 'master' into change
cf46bbb change index
1be733a change index						to here

but with the command `git checkout HEAD~3` you get:

2c77f9b (HEAD -> change) change index		from here,
5e557f1 Merge branch 'master' into change
cf46bbb change index
1be733a change index
2e57c4a Merge branch 'change'				to here.

## git reflog

see witch branches you were before (jump history.).

## git rebase

files in branches: 

branch master:
	index: "this is a file"

branch bran2: 
	index: "this is another file"

branches:

```
o | -> some other commit in master
| 0 -> commit in bran2
|/
o ->initial cmt (branch = master)
```

to rebase the current branch with an other one branch: 

do not rebase the master first. start with the other one.

in the bran2:

`git rebase master`

branches:

```
| 0 -> commit in bran2	\
|/			 | the bran2 synchronized with the head of the master branch.
o -> some other commit  /
|    in master 
|
o ->initial cmt (branch = master)
```

now, in the master branch, 

`git rebase bran2`

```
0 -> commit in bran2	\
|			 | the bran2 and master are now, one.
o -> some other commit  /
|    in master 
|
o ->initial cmt (branch = master)
```
